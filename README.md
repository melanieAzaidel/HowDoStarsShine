# How Do Stars Shine?
This respository contains files pertaining to my Doctoral Candidacy Exam, the topic of which was "How do stars shine? (According to physicists.)" as part of the Ohio State University Department of Physics Physics Ph.D. program.

The Written and Oral portions of my Candidacy Exam can be found on my <a href="https://u.osu.edu/mzaidel/portfolio/candidacy-exam/">website</a>.

The remaining files and folders contain code and solar model files to generate figures throughout my exam.

The Images folder contains various figures generated for my exam deliverables as seen in the Written and Oral portions.

The Processing solar models folder contains files associated with collecting and smoothing radial variables in the reference solar model. Smoothed_Solar_Model.csv contains the smoothed collection of radial variables used to generate figures in my exam. The file n_e.csv contains the profile of the solar number density of electrons for quick reference. The solar model is the one described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412440">https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412440</a>.

Mk1 Fusion Reactor.ipynb contains Python functions for generating the nuclear reaction rates for selected reactions of the pp chain and CNO bi-cycle. Astrophysical S factors come from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06470">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06470</a>.

Physics Sanxbox.ipynb contains code for generating a neat demonstration of the Gamow peak for p-p fusion.

Solar Model Plotter.ipynb contains the code for generating the majority of figures relating to solar model variables in my exam.

Temperature Gradient and Energy.ipynb contains code for plotting the radiative temperature gradient and energy generation rates throughout the Sun.
