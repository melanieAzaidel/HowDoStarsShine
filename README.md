# How Do Stars Shine?
This respository contains files pertaining to my Doctoral Candidacy Exam, the topic of which was "How do stars shine? (According to physicists.)" as part of the Ohio State University Department of Physics Physics Ph.D. program. The files and folders contain code and solar model files to generate figures throughout my exam.

The Written and Oral portions of my Candidacy Exam can be found on my <a href="https://u.osu.edu/mzaidel/portfolio/candidacy-exam/">website</a> or in the <a href="https://github.com/melanieAzaidel/HowDoStarsShine/tree/main/Exam%20Documents">Exam Documents</a> folder.

The <a href="https://github.com/melanieAzaidel/HowDoStarsShine/tree/main/Images">Images</a> folder contains various figures generated for my exam deliverables as seen in the Written and Oral portions.

The <a href="https://github.com/melanieAzaidel/HowDoStarsShine/tree/main/Processing%20solar%20models">Processing solar models</a> folder contains files associated with collecting and smoothing radial variables in the reference solar model. <a href="https://github.com/melanieAzaidel/HowDoStarsShine/blob/main/Smoothed_Solar_Model.csv">Smoothed_Solar_Model.csv</a> contains the smoothed collection of radial variables used to generate figures in my exam. The file <a href="https://github.com/melanieAzaidel/HowDoStarsShine/blob/main/n_e.csv">n_e.csv</a> contains the profile of the solar number density of electrons for quick reference. The solar model is the one described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412440">https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412440</a>.

<a href="https://github.com/melanieAzaidel/HowDoStarsShine/blob/main/Mk1%20Fusion%20Reactor.ipynb">Mk1 Fusion Reactor.ipynb.csv</a> contains Python functions for generating the nuclear reaction rates for selected reactions of the pp chain and CNO bi-cycle. Astrophysical S factors come from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06470">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06470</a>.

<a href="https://github.com/melanieAzaidel/HowDoStarsShine/blob/main/Physics%20Sandbox.ipynb">Physics Sandbox.ipynb</a> contains code for generating a neat demonstration of the Gamow peak for p-p fusion.

<a href="https://github.com/melanieAzaidel/HowDoStarsShine/blob/main/Solar%20Model%20Plotter.ipynb">Solar Model Plotter.ipynb</a> contains the code for generating the majority of figures relating to solar model variables in my exam.

<a href="https://github.com/melanieAzaidel/HowDoStarsShine/blob/main/Temperature%20Gradient%20and%20Energy.ipynb">Temperature Gradient and Energy.ipynb</a> contains code for plotting the radiative temperature gradient and energy generation rates throughout the Sun.
